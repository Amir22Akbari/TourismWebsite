		<h1> Biking Paths & Bike Tours </h1>
			<p> There are many services within London that provide bike tours, so that tourists can explore through the streets of London.
			Tourists can follow through a curated experience while on bikes, so that the experience is as hassle-free as possible.
			Bike tours help tourists to avoid crowds, since the tour guides are able to navigate through London easily. </p>
			<p> Tours can last anywhere from 2 hours to 4 hours, and require tourists to rent or buy a bike. </p>

		<h1>Railroad Map of London Trains and Subways </h1>
			<p> The London Underground is one of the most popular means of transportation throughout London. Even though used purely for travel, the experience is also considered by many to be a tourist destination by itself. </p>

			<p> Ticket pricing can vary based on date, distance, and location. Check <a href=https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/>booking prices</a> in advance before traveling. </p>

		<h1> Navigation Apps & Taxi Services</h1>
			<p> London black cabs are a prominent part of the city, and service tourists and residents alike. Any black cab is available for
			passengers to hail, as long as the yellow sign on the front is lit up. However, if the waiting time for hailing a cab is too long,
			tourists and residents can instead hire private minicabs. </p>
			<p>However, all minicab trips must be booked in advance, and minicab services
			without a prior booking are considered illegal. This means minicab trips which are not booked are uninsured, so tourists should beware. <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/getting-around-london/london-taxis">Source </a></p>
			<p> The <a href="https://gett.com/uk/city/london/">Gett app</a> is a popular choice for booking London black cabs.</p>

		<h1> Boating </h1>
		<p> While not a common mode of transportation, boat travel is available for tourists in the form of boating tours as well as river buses. The most popular river to
		take a boat tour on is the River Thames.</p>
		<p> If tourists want to travel by boat without a tour, Uber Boat by Thames Clippers is one of the most popular choices. </p>
		<p> Passengers pay a one-time fare for each trip. Check <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/river-fares?intcmp=54711">pricing</a> before traveling.</p>

	<div id="alexdisplay5">
		<h1>Bus Routes </h1>
		<p> The double-decker buses of London can provide a scenic street view of the buildings and architecture. They are a common sight in the densely packed urban environment.</p>
		<p> Buses can only be boarded after payment, which can either be a one-time bus fare, or after paying for a Bus & Tram pass. Bus & Tram passes vary with different time limits, from one day, seven days, monthly, or annual passes available.</p>
